Environmental sound classification can be applied to many daily life scenarios, and can be used to identify abnormal events nearby. We proposed a framework to classify these environmental sounds.
In signal Processing, spectrogram is a representation of short-term freqeuncy power distribution of a sound. 
Mel-Frequency Cepstrum (MFC) is also representation of the short-term power spectrum of a sound like spectrogram, but it scaled the power which make MFC more closed to human hearing. 
\begin{comment}
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are coefficients that collectively make up an MFC.
MFCCs can usually be applied to extract sound features.
\end{comment}
The ability of deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to learn spectral patterns makes them well suited to environmental sound classification. We proposed a DCNN model based on MFCCs and spectrogram, which can capture signal signature precisely.
